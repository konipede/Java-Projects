# Java Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains two advanced Java projects demonstrating data structures and algorithms implementations:

1. **Car Inventory System** - A priority queue-based car management system using DLB (De La Briandais) trees
2. **Network Analysis** - Graph algorithms for network connectivity and path analysis

## Projects

###  [Car Inventory System](./car-inventory-system/)
A sophisticated car inventory management system that uses priority queues and DLB trees to efficiently manage and query car data by price and mileage.

**Key Features:**
- Priority queue implementation for price and mileage sorting
- DLB (De La Briandais) tree for fast string searching
- Efficient car lookup and updates

###  [Network Analysis](./network-analysis/)
A comprehensive network analysis tool implementing graph algorithms for analyzing network connectivity, finding shortest paths, and determining network resilience.

**Key Features:**
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding
- Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees
- Articulation point detection for network resilience
- Bandwidth and latency analysis

## Technologies

- **Language:** Java
- **Data Structures:** Priority Queues, Graphs, DLB Trees, Bags
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's, Prim's, DFS, Articulation Points
